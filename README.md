# Capstone Car Search
> In July of 2022, I was in a head-on auto collision. My vehicle was wrecked and I was hunting for a new car. I was very concerned about the next vehicle I would purchase, as though I had no clue what type I should get. This motivated me to look for data that could show different automobile comparisons. I have developed a strong interest in automobile safety and need to identify the best cars for me. The intended audience for this presentation includes but is not limited to individuals searching for a new automobile, automobile competitors, car safety advocates/liaisons, and government officials that could potentially improve legislation around the topic.

## General Information
- After recently experiencing a jarring car accident, I was placed in a position of finding a new automobile that is affordable, safe, and has unique features. I pulled Town of Cary, NC Crash data from data.world and 2019 Car Price data from Kaggle. I pose the following questions: Which automobiles have the best value based on prices and features? Are Cars or SUVs more prone to car accidents? The final capstone will contain a variety of charts, maps, and graphs to analyze automobiles based on their prices and features. The analysis will be presented via a Tableau story. I foresee challenges with merging the datasets, ensuring the headings of columns align, and finding similarities to link the data being analyzed.
